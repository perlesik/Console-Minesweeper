# Console-Minesweeper
Minesweeper for command line which I made from scratch during free time at my university, initially to perform unit tests for a project for one of my classes. It still has a couple of minor bugs and todo items, most important being implementation of mines generation algorithm that prevents 50/50 situations (which I want to come up with myself, like the rest of the code).
